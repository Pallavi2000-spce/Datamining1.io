<h2 style="color:purple;">Introduction of Data Mining</h2><br/>
<p><strong>Data mining</strong> is the process of extracting patterns from data ,<br/>Data mining is becoming an increasingly<br/> important tool to
 transform,<br/> this data into information,
<img src="mining.jpg" width="300px" height="190px" align="right"/>
<br/>It is commonly used in a wide,<br/> range of profiling practices,<br/> such as marketing, surveillance, <br/>fraud detection and scientific discovery,<br/>
<strong>Data mining</strong> can be used to uncover,<br/> patterns in data but is ,<br/>.often carried out only on samples of data.
<br/> The mining process will be ineffective if,<br/> the samples are not a good,<br/> representation of the larger body of data.
<br/> Data mining cannot discover patterns that may be<br/> present in the larger body of data if those patterns<br/> are not present in the sample being "mined".
 <br/>
<h2 style="color:green;"> History of Data mining</h2>
<div>
  <br/><img src="history.jpg" width="280px" height="210px" align="right"/>
</div>
<p>You might think the history of Data Mining started very recently as,
<br/> it is commonly considered with new technology.<br/> However data mining is a discipline with a long history
<br/>. It starts with the early Data Mining methods Bayes’<br/> Theorem (1700`s)and Regression analysis (1800`s) ,<br/>which were mostly identifying patterns
 in data.</p>
<h2 style="color:purple;">What is mean By Data Mininng</h2>
<strong> Data mining</strong> has applications in multiple fields, like science and research.
<br/> As an application of data mining, businesses can learn more,
<br/> about their customers and develop more effective strategies ,<br/>related to various business functions and,<br/> in turn leverage resources in a more optimal and insightful manner.
<br/> This helps businesses be closer to their objective and make better decisions.<br/> Data mining involves effective data collection and<br/>
 warehousing as well as computer processing.
 <br/>For segmenting the data and evaluating the probability of future events,
 <br/>data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms.<br/> Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).</p>

<h2 style="color:purple;">Working of Data Mining</h2>
<p> There is an abundance of data across various industries,<br/> but it only becomes useful when it is transformed into information. 
<br/>The method of extracting information from enormous data<br/> is known as data mining. 
<br/>Data mining find its application across various industries <br/>such as market analysis, business management,
<br/> fraud inspection, corporate analysis and risk management, among others,<br/>
This article takes a short tour of the steps involved in data mining.</p>

<h2 style="color:green;">Techniqes of Data Mining</h2>
<h3>1.Regression</h3>
<p>Regression is a data mining technique used to predict a,<br/> range of numeric values (also called continuous values), <br/>given a particular dataset. For example,<br/> regression might be used to predict the cost of a product or service,<br/> given other variables.</p>
<img src="t.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="400"/>
<h3>2.Classification</h3>
<p>It is a Data analysis task,<br/> i.e. the process of finding a model that describes and<br/> distinguishes data classes and concepts.
 <br/><strong>Classification</strong> is the problem of identifying to <br/>which of a set of categories (subpopulations),
<br/> a new observation belongs to, on the basis of a training set of,<br/> data containing observations and whose <br/>categories membership is known.</p>
<h3>3.Clustering</h3>
<p> The process of making a group of abstract objects into<br/> classes of similar objects is   known as clustering.<br/>
In the process of cluster analysis,<br/> the first step is to partition the set of data,<br/> into groups with the help of,
<br/> data similarity, and then groups are ,<br/>assigned to their respective lables.</p>
<h3>4.Association</h3>
<p> In basic terms, association rules ,<br/>present relations between items.
<br/> They are statements that help to discover ,<br/>relationships between data in a database.
<br/> An association rule can be defined as an implication of the,<br/> form A → B. Here ‘A’ is called premise, 
<br/>which represents a condition that must be true<br/> for ‘B’ to hold. ‘B’ is a conclusion that happens ,
<br/>when ‘A’ is true. ‘A’ is called antecedent<br/> and ‘B’ is called consequent. 
<br/>An antecedent is an element found in ,data<br/> where as a consequent is
<img src="h.jpg" width="250px" height="210px" align="right"/>
<br/> found in combination with the antecedent. <br/>The rule A → B can be interpreted <br/>as: If A happens, B happens,
<br/> This is a very general interpretation; <br/>the accurate interpretation depends on the domain.</p>
